 * Our goal in the decouple function is to create two numbers in \f$ [1, q] \f$. The result from the 
 * hmac based on sha256 (function hmac(...)) therefore has to be reduced in some way.
 * For this, the result of the hmac is expanded to a certain number of bits
 * in order for the subsequent reduction modulo the order q to have as little redundancy as possible
 * and for the result to keep its pseudo random property. \n
 * In effect, with q the order of the bilinear groups, we are looking to make the statistical approximation:
 * \f[
 *  [1,q] \sim [1,2^{\lambda'}]
 * \f]
 * Where any element of \f$ [1,2^{\lambda'}] \f$ would be reduced modulo q. To this effect,
 * we are looking to minimize the statistical distance between those two sets. This translates to the formula:
 * \f[
 * \sum_{i=1}^{q} |P(X_2 = i) - P(X_1 [q] = i))| \leq 2^{-\lambda}
 * \f]
